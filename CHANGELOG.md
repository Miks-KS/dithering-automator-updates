  - **Everything** (default) - Randomizes both algorithm and colors
  - **Algorithm only** - Randomizes algorithm, preserves colors  
  - **Colors only** - Randomizes colors, preserves algorithm
- Duplicate prevention ensures that consecutive clicks always produce different results

![Custom pattern icons](./docs/images/custom-pattern-icons.png)  

**Loading indicator in Batch Process modal**
- Added a loading spinner indicator that shows up when loading files in the Batch Processor
- The spinner will appear if file loading takes longer than 500ms
- This is just a small UX improvement that prevents the modal from staying blank for a while and looking like it's frozen when loading a lot of images

![Batch process loading](./docs/images/batch-process-spinner.png)

### ‚ú® New Features

**Canvas size limit protection**
- Added validation system to prevent corrupted image exports when upscale settings exceed browser canvas limits

**Auto-clamping resolution changes**
- When adjusting the resolution slider, the upscale percentage automatically reduces to safe values if needed

This update prevents the corrupted export issue that could occur with very large upscale percentages on high resolution images.

- New preference option to control whether image adjustments (brightness, contrast, levels, etc.) are automatically reset when uploading new images
